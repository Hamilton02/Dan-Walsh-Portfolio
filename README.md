# Portfolio
/*
 *This portfolio is a collection of all personal and academic projects for Daniel Walsh. COEN 12 Data Structres was a C class about creating data structres to sort and count works in books. COEN 146 was a computer networks class about exploring all 5 layers that data must pass through to be delivered from clients to server and vice versa. These were coded in C as well.
