# Portfolio

 *This portfolio is a collection of all personal and academic projects for Daniel Walsh. COEN 12 Data Structures was a C class about creating data structures to sort and count works in books. COEN 146 was a computer networks class about exploring all 5 layers that data must pass through to be delivered from clients to server and vice versa. These were coded in C as well. There is also a couple personal projects and class assignments from COEN 60, Intro to Web Technology.
